# AVI Metadata processor

I recently ripped an old camcorder (Sony DCR-TRV145E PAL) of my uncle.
I wanted the files to include the correct dates which the ripping software kindly wrote into the filenames, but not into the metadata.
Obviously only a mad person would write code himself in 2022, so I turned to ChatGPT.
This project has no file (other than this part of the readme) written by me. All code is only copied from ChatGPT.

Okay.. Lets see if ChatGPT can write a summary of what it does.

`Malaber left the game.`
